Welcome to visit my homepage!  

My name is Zhang Wenjie. I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [International School of Business Finance](https://isbf.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). I am about to graduate from my undergraduate program and have been successfully admitted to the Master's program in Applied Economics (Academic Master). 

Although my majority is Finance, I'm much more interest on Urban Econnomics. Also, I have some intersts on Econometics, Labor Economics, Environmental Economics and Economic History. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Li Teng](https://isbf.sysu.edu.cn/zh-hans/teacher/271). I'm also very lucky to be a member of International Economic Research Center and being advised by [Prof. Huang Xinfei](https://isbf.sysu.edu.cn/zh-hans/teacher/249) I am very grateful that Prof. Huang Xinfei and Prof. Li Teng are willing to write recommendation letters for me during my postgraduate recommendation process. 

Now I have a wechat public account "鸭鸭不知所云". I often in the leisure time to update the content of the cutting-edge papers, Stata, Zotero, LaTeX and Markdown.
